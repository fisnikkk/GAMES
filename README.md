# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and the Streamlit and Pygame libraries. The game allows two players to control paddles on opposite sides of the screen and compete to score points by hitting the ball past their opponent's paddle.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pygame

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install streamlit pygame


## How to Run

To run the Pong game, follow these steps:

1. Save the code in a Python file (e.g., `pong_game.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the following command:

streamlit run pong_game.py


5. The game will launch in your default web browser.

## How to Play

- Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to control the left paddle, moving it up and down respectively.
- Use the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to control the right paddle, moving it up and down respectively.
- The objective of the game is to hit the ball past your opponent's paddle and score points.
- The game will continue until one player reaches the maximum score or decides to quit.

## Customization

The Pong game allows you to customize the screen size by adjusting the width and height sliders in the sidebar. You can modify the default screen size values (`640` for width and `480` for height) to suit your preferences.

## Acknowledgements
